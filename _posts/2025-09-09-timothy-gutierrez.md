## 👨‍🏫 Profile
I am currently associate professor in the Department of General Studies at Nihon University’s College of Humanities and Sciences. As a steering committee member of the Foreign Language Education Division of the Global Research Education Center I oversee lunchtime conversation activities and the graded reader library. After completing my masters’ degree at California State University, Hayward, I have been teaching in Japan since 1999. I see great promise in my ludic interests of tabletop role-playing games and interactive fiction for engaging foreign language learners of English as a method of engaging learners more deeply in Task-Based Language Learning and Extensive Reading and Learning methods of increasing their English Language fluency.
