# Submission types

## 🏞 Playground items (Easy Mode)

The LLP Playground is full of amazing teaching and research items which can be published, discussed, reviewed and **peer-reviewed** if requested by the author. Want to know more? Head over to the <a href="/2020/04/04/playground-landing.html">playground page</a>

## 🚶‍♂️ Walkthroughs (Normal Mode)

Submissions in this category show what ludic language pedagogy looks like in hi-resolution. We appropriate the game design metaphor of iterative playtesting; where teachers actively improve their teaching through a process of iteration. Walkthroughs are organised into the following key sections: 

**Background → Design → Playtest → Evaluation → Next steps.**

We advise teachers to include extensive media and teaching materials, such as:

Curriculum and syllabus, lesson plans, teacher notes (e.g., diaries and observations), worksheets, student work (e.g., projects, reports, presentations, completed worksheets), tests, quizzes, grading rubrics, photos, videos, example interactions, and anecdotes.

## 📔 Articles (Hard Mode)

Submissions in this category typically map out and find gaps in relevant scholarly literature, have clear and compelling research questions, present a procedure and data to answer those questions, and end with a thoughtful discussion related to continued research and teaching. Alternatively, a submission might explain or critique a phenomenon or trend in the field. Topics include research, pedagogy, theory, and practice. Manuscripts should have clear implications for practice. We welcome all research approaches, methods, and contexts.

We welcome papers that aim to:

- push the field forwards
- question the field’s current trajectory
- end with more questions than they started with
- create a manifesto or a call to action.
