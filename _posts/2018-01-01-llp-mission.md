LLP is a non-profit project to bring together people and promote conversations around how best to integrate games and play into language teaching and learning.

# Mission

The mission of Ludic Language Pedagogy is to promote open, scholarly and practical conversations around purposeful and progressive uses of games and play in language teaching and learning.

We are committed to:

- Promoting ideas, experiences and research that investigate the mindful intersection of games and language teaching and learning,
- Curating materials (submitted in conjunction with manuscripts) that other teachers and researchers can use in their contexts,
- Communicating with the community, not only through this journal but via SNS and regular public connections (podcast, webinars, Discord channels, etc.).

We have designed and will continue to work with this process to make submissions simple and collaborative.
