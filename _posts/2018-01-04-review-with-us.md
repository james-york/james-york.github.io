# Reviewer guidelines

As a reviewer for LLP, you are not a gatekeeper. Rather, you work closely with authors to help them develop their ideas and experiences in line with the mission of the journal. Your work, alongside theirs, helps to develop the field and to inspire, educate and support teachers and researchers. In order for this to happen, reviewers need to:

## Be supportive. 

Criticism is incredibly important. The field has no chance to grow if we only congratulate each other, and ignore troublesome topics. However, criticisms should be as constructive as possible. Consider adding recommendations or advice when critiquing authorsâ€™ work.

## Be engaged and responsible. 

Unlike traditional review processes, LLP utilizes OPR, which allows for a conversation between reviewers and authors about the manuscript, on the manuscript. This has the potential to rapidly decrease the length of time for reviews. However, this depends on your cooperation!

## Be true to the LLP mission.

The mission of Ludic Language Pedagogy is to promote open, scholarly and practical conversations around purposeful and progressive uses of games and play in language teaching and learning.

We are committed to:

- Promoting ideas, experiences and research that investigate the mindful intersection of games and language teaching and learning,
- Curating materials (submitted in conjunction with manuscripts) that other teachers and researchers can use in their contexts,
- Communicating with the community, not only through this journal but via SNS and regular public connections (podcast, webinars, Slack channels, etc.).
