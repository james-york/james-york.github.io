# Reviewer guidelines

## üëÅ We practice **open, not blind, peer review.** 

In line with the [F1000 Research OPR oath](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-271/v2), we expect reviewers to conduct themselves based on the following four principles.

- Principle 1: I will sign my name to my review
- Principle 2: I will review with integrity
- Principle 3: I will treat the review as a discourse with you; in particular, I will provide constructive criticism
- Principle 4: I will be an ambassador for the practice of open science

## Be supportive. 

Criticism is incredibly important. The field has no chance to grow if we only congratulate each other, and ignore troublesome topics. However, criticisms should be as constructive as possible. Consider adding recommendations or advice when critiquing authors‚Äô work.

## Be engaged and responsible. 

Unlike traditional review processes, LLP utilizes OPR, which allows for a conversation between reviewers and authors about the manuscript, on the manuscript. This has the potential to rapidly decrease the length of time for reviews. However, this depends on your cooperation!

## Be true to the LLP mission.

The mission of Ludic Language Pedagogy is to promote open, scholarly and practical conversations around purposeful and progressive uses of games and play in language teaching and learning.

We are committed to:

- Promoting ideas, experiences and research that investigate the mindful intersection of games and language teaching and learning,
- Curating materials (submitted in conjunction with manuscripts) that other teachers and researchers can use in their contexts,
- Communicating with the community, not only through this journal but via SNS and regular public connections (podcast, webinars, Slack channels, etc.).
