Ludic Language Pedagogy is an open-access journal and community dedicated to promoting explorations of teaching and learning using games. We play, we explore, we share, we discuss. We are serious about our community being a space (a “magic circle”) where our members can play, explore, share and discuss ideas safely and freely. And where **anyone is welcome to come and play.**

We are committed to **including and promoting any voice,** especially of people who find it difficult to make their voices heard. We encourage anyone to submit their experiences of using games and play in language teaching and learning to the journal.

The journal **rejects practices that engage in prejudice based on race, sex, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, socioeconomic status, body type, or age.** By challenging and critiquing such forms of oppression, we contribute to a more just vision of society.

We are committed to helping junior teachers and researchers share their work. If you need help developing an idea, please let us know. You can email us, or join our community slack server. We will work with you to help you do what you want to do. We welcome students sharing their work.

We are also committed to helping anyone, especially minorities and people of color express their ideas in the academic community. Before we started this journal, we didn’t have a place to share our teaching and research in this field. We have gained some social capital and some small bit of power by starting this journal. We are committed to helping other people gain power through this journal. If you would like to have an editorial role or voice in this journal, to learn and do more, to establish or develop your career, please let us know. The journal is a serious endeavour, but many of the ways in which we operate are based on playful ideas and conceptions. The more voices and backgrounds involved, the greater our ability to create a truly unique place for all to enjoy. We seek to not simply invite minoritized groups to join us, but welcome you. If you are interested in gaming and language pedagogy, you are one of us.

Given the importance of play as a universal activity, and how both play and language are socially and culturally mediated, the topics we engage with are especially relevant areas of study for contributing to more just societies. Who plays, and how and what they play, and how these activities shape language learning and use, are questions closely related to issues of identity, both individual and collective, and therefore integral aspects of understanding and shaping the worlds in which we live. We cannot ignore how racism and gender-related intolerance endanger children and youth at play, nor are we unaware of the ways in which (language) play enables vulnerable groups to resist oppression. Understanding play as part of the human condition imbues us with a moral obligation to support game studies, and scholars of game studies, especially from those BIPOC and LGBTQIA* scholars whose voices have not been adequately amplified. We equally support access to education about, with, and through games for all learners as a means to ensure equitable participation in and beyond the language learning classroom.

**We stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter in the fight against systemic racism.**

If anyone has any suggestions about how Ludic Language Pedagogy can do better in society, please let us know and work with us to see that happen.
