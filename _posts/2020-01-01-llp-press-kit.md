# Representing LLP

Hello! 

This page is a "press kit" of sorts. 
It's a place where we are hosting LLP art assets that we hope you will use in your presentations or talks to help spread the word about the journal and hopefully bring more people into our community.

Some quick details:

- We use the Roboto font on our site and publications.
- The hexcode for the first L colour is <span style="color:#867ade;">#867ade</span>.
- The hexcode for the second L colour is <span style="color:#9351b6;">#9351b6</span>.
- The hexcode for the P colour is <span style="color:#b2ec91;">#b2ec91</span>.
- The art is created using the PETSCII character set ([details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETSCII)).
- Our website is [https://www.llpjournal.org](https://www.llpjournal.org).
- We are on Twitter at [@llpjournal](https://www.twitter.com/llpjournal).
