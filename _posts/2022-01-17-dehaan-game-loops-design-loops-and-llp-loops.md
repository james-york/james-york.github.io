## Abstract

- **What is this?** An exploration of well-designed games, game design ‚Äúbest practices,‚Äù solid steps in my Game Terakoya teaching, and straightforward questions for other teachers using games. I‚Äôll loop back again and again ;) in this paper to the central concept of ‚Äúloops:‚Äù sequences or systems that repeat and vary to different educational or entertaining effects.
- **Why did you make it?** I read and think a lot about games and game design. I also spend a lot of time designing and improving my teaching. I noticed the connections and wanted to create something that would help other teachers think about the loops in their teaching as well.
- **Who is it for?** It‚Äôs for experienced teachers: you‚Äôve been teaching for ‚Äúforever‚Äù ‚Ä¶ step back a bit from your work and think about whether your teaching is overly complex and not ‚Äúloopy‚Äù enough. Let‚Äôs all aim for some elegant ludic language pedagogy!
