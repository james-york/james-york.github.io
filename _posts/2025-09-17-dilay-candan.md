## üë®‚Äçüè´ Profile
I am a PhD student in Applied Linguistics and an ESL instructor with a focus on pronunciation and writing pedagogy and corpus-informed language teaching. My current research explores chatbot-based games to implement DDL for pragmalinguistics and sociopragmatics teaching as well as innovative approaches to pronunciation instruction, particularly the integration of gamification with corpus-based tools like YouGlish to enhance learner engagement and outcomes. I am interested in how usage-based theory and High Variability Phonetic Training can be operationalized through digital platforms to create more effective and enjoyable learning experiences for spoken interactions. In my research and teaching practice, I explore and implement technology-enhanced activities that bridge theoretical research with practical classroom applications, helping students develop both linguistic abilities and cultural awareness through authentic language exposure.
