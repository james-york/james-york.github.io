## Ludic Language Pedagogy Open Peer Review Guide

Dear reviewers, 

Our driving philosophy/slogan for the open-peer review (OPR) process is:

![](/assets/images/opr-ring.png){:.rounded.shadow}

By this, we mean that all communication should, where possible, occur on the submitted manuscript itself.

## Initial review 

1. Use comments directly on the manuscript to:

- Ask questions
- Make suggestions
- Give praise

2. Complete a formal review **at the end of the manuscript**

- ✅ Complete the reviewer form.
- ✅ Complete the box "Initial Recommendation."
- ✅ Complete the box “Review Stage.” 
- ✅ Message the custom Discord channel when the steps have been completed.

## Revision stage

- ✅ Check and resolve the authors revisions (as suggestions in GDocs).
- ✅ Resolve any of your comments that have been addressed by the author.
- ✅ Once all your comments are closed, complete the "Revised Manuscript Recommendation" section.
- ✅ Message the custom Discord channel when the steps have been completed.
