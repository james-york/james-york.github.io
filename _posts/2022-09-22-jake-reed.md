## 👨‍🏫 Profile

My research interest in language learning/teaching is largely in Games Based Language Learning (GBLL). As a gamer in my personal life, I am constantly encouraged by the power of games as a medium to tell stories, bring people together, and provide an atmosphere promoting active engagement. Combined, I believe these aspects help to provide fertile soil in which language learning can take place. I am currently researching how these affordances can be leveraged by teachers and learners in language-learning settings, with particular focus on the board game and Tabletop Role-playing Game genres.
