## Abstract

- **What is this?** It‚Äôs a piece of writing exploring the development of a small international ecolinguistics pilot project that used Animal Crossing New Horizons (ACNH) as a vehicle to connect university students and researchers in conversation about issues of environmental and community sustainability.
- **Why did you make it?** We wanted to share and make sense of what we tried, what we learned, and we wanted to explore ideas for possible future iterations.
- **Who is it for?** People interested in exploring the use ACNH, or similar games, as a vehicle for meaningful discussion about environmental and social issues.
