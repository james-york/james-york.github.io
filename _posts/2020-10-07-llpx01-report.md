## 🔑 Key points

- **What is this?** This is a collection of short talks and lesson plans made by participants of LLPx01. Teachers presented Ludic, Language and Pedagogy elements, then were grouped into teams which had 45 minutes to create a lesson plan, activity, class, workshop or curriculum.
- **What did they make?** Creations included: "DO IT YOURSELF!!!!!!!!" "Spreading of viruses and ideas" "GAME: Giving Analytical Maneuverability to Educators"
- **Why did you make it?** We want to share more Ludic, Language and Pedagogy elements with each other and other teaching and research communities. If you want to implement or modify these plans, you can! We would be happy to help you do so. Join our Slack to chat with the Iron Teachers.
