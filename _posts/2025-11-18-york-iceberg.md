## KEY POINTS

- **What is this?** This framework offers a robust lens for understanding the potential of games in educational settings. It begins with well-established “surface-level” applications familiar to educators, researchers, and policymakers. However, as we delve deeper, less apparent and more impactful approaches emerge. These deeper levels represent a greater potential for transformative learning but are currently underutilized. Significantly, Level 6, "Wrap games in pedagogy," serves as a foundational principle, informing and enhancing all other levels.
- **Why did you make it?** To empower teachers, researchers, and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of the diverse and effective ways games can be integrated to achieve meaningful learning outcomes.
- **Who is it for?** As detailed above, this framework is specifically designed for teachers, researchers, and policymakers.
