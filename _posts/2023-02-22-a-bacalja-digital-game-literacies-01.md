## Abstract

- **Background**: Claims that digital games will save education have long emphasized features of the medium to support their arguments.
- **Aim**: This paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of a sociocultural approach to digital game literacies.
- **Methods**: I analyse literature associated with digital game literacies, as well as findings from case studies, to demonstrate the value of going beyond the medium and instead privileging game-related literacy practices.
- **Results**: The medium is not enough. It is only when digital games are positioned within social and cultural contexts that we can fully understand how they might contribute to school learning.
- **Conclusion**: The learning that might emerge from the inclusion of digital games into school-based curricula will require teachers and educators to carefully consider how digital game literacies can bridge the gap with the disciplinary school literacies that dominate schooling.
