## Key Points
- **What is this?** This is an evaluation of RPG video games as an alternative
to books or other materials for the purposes of extensive reading, a
language acquisition method with decades of support.
- **Why did you make it?** When playing some of my favorite games I
noticed just how much reading I was doing. I wanted to see if RPG video
games could satisfy the conditions for a successful extensive reading
program.
- **Who is it for?** This is for teachers who are interested in or already
running an extensive reading program but finding some students lack
interest. It could also be for students who have plateaued in their
language learning efforts and are looking for a way to use their hobby to
respark their progress.
