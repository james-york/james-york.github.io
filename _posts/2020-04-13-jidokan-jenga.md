## Tweet Synopsis 

> Let students play simple games in their L1. It’s ok! 

> Then:

> - You, the teacher, can help them critique the game in their L2.
> - You, the teacher, can help them change the game in their L2.
> - You, the teacher, can help them develop themselves.

## Key points

- 📍 What is this? This is a recollection of a short lesson with some children. I used Jenga and a dictionary.
- 📍 Why did you make it? I want to show language teachers that simple games, and playing simple games in students’ first language can be a great foundation for helping students learn new vocabulary, think critically, and exercise creativity.
- 📍 Why is it radical? I taught using a simple board game (at a time when video games are over-focused on in research). I show what the learning looks like (I include a photo). The teaching and learning didn’t occur in a laboratory setting, but in the wild (in a community center). I focused on the learning around games.
- 📍 Who is it for? Language teachers can easily implement this lesson using Jenga or any other game. Language researchers can expand on the translating and remixing potential around games.
