## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I have been exploring the use of role-playing games in both English language and college composition classrooms as a way to increase student motivation and lower affective filter. I'm interested in both face-to-face and online teaching and discovering how games can be used in both contexts to improve rapport among students and instructors.
