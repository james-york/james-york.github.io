**Abstract**
Dr. Gordon Freeman will explore how games can transform educational experiences, drawing on his unique perspective as both a scientist and a game protagonist. His keynote will highlight the cognitive and social benefits of game-based learning, share insights from the Half-Life series, and discuss practical strategies for integrating games into classrooms. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how interactive play can unlock new pathways for engagement, collaboration, and lifelong learning.
