## 👨‍🏫 Profile

In the last 15 years, I have taught in four different countries, in three different languages and students from a wide range of social and economic backgrounds. In these contexts, I have worked with language learners ranging from pre-k to university-level. Currently, I teach graduate-level courses on the use of games in education and mobile app development for learning. I have recently finished data collection for my dissertation, through which I designed and built an open-world 2D RPG game for young dual language learners of Chinese. My goal is to illustrate how games can be used to not only promote meaningful interaction between learners and the text but also capture learning via stealth assessments that are embedded in the game tasks.
