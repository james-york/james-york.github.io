## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I am currently a PhD student located in the Cotswolds of England. I have been playing Animal Crossing daily since I was five years old, and am centring my doctoral thesis around the folkloric journey of the tanuki through an ecolinguistic lens. Aside from my PhD, I also work in a bookshop, and am currently working with my University and the QAA on a paid research project to develop inclusion of Education for Sustainability within the taught undergraduate curriculum.
