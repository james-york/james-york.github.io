## Tweet Synopsis 

> Hi, language teachers! :)
> You’re using games to help students speak, right? Great!
> I’ve shared #10greatactivities and #freematerials you can use in your class today! What do you think?
> #gamebasedlearning #top10list #helpingteachers #realgamification



## Key points

- 📍 **What is this?** This is a list of 10 activities that teachers can use before, during
and after games in class. There are teaching scripts and free materials for each.
- 📍 **Why did you make it?** I think a lot of teachers use games for speaking practice, which is great, but there are many more things that can be done with games. I’d like to help. I’d like teachers to share their activities and materials, too!
- 📍 **Why is it radical?** These activities work with any game (video game, board game, traditional game .. anything!). Lots of websites list “great games” but not many share research-tested teaching materials. These materials tap into the power teachers have to help learners before, during and after games.
- 📍 **Who is it for?** Any teacher, any student, any classroom context.
