# üìî Articles 

Submissions in this category typically map out and find gaps in relevant scholarly literature, have clear and compelling research questions, present a procedure and data to answer those questions, and end with a thoughtful discussion related to continued research and teaching. Alternatively, a submission might explain or critique a phenomenon or trend in the field. Topics include research, pedagogy, theory, and practice. Manuscripts should have clear implications for practice. We welcome all research approaches, methods, and contexts.

We welcome papers that aim to:

- push the field forwards
- question the field‚Äôs current trajectory
- end with more questions than they started with
- create a manifesto or a call to action.

# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walkthroughs

Submissions in this category show what ludic language pedagogy looks like in hi-resolution. We appropriate the game design metaphor of iterative playtesting; where teachers actively improve their teaching through a process of iteration. Walkthroughs are organised into the following key sections: 

**Background ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Playtest ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Next steps.**

**Guiding questions for each section are provided below.**

- **Background:**
  - Who are you and your students? Where did you teach? What literature, ideas or experiences influenced or inspired you? What was your goal? Why that goal?

- **Design:**
  - How did the background influence your design decisions? Describe your lesson plans, materials, game choices, etc.

- **Playtest:** 
  - What happened? Narrate the intervention from start to finish. What did you and the students do?

- **Evaluation:** 
  - Critically reflect on the playtest. Support your reflections with specific examples.
    - The good/epic: What was a success? What went well? What worked?
	- The bad/ugly: What was a failure? What didn‚Äôt go well? What didn‚Äôt work?
	- What are the practical implications for other teachers‚Äô classrooms?

- **Next steps:** 
  - Will you continue (or is it GAME OVER)? What does the next stage look like?

We advise teachers to include extensive media and teaching materials, such as:

Curriculum and syllabus, lesson plans, teacher notes (e.g., diaries and observations), worksheets, student work (e.g., projects, reports, presentations, completed worksheets), tests, quizzes, grading rubrics, photos, videos, example interactions, and anecdotes.
We encourage authors to look at these for inspiration.
