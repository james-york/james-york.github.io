## üë®‚Äçüè´ Profile

Mona has been teaching French language to multilingual learners for the past four years. She recently completed a Master of Teaching degree at the Ontario Institute of Studies in Education, University of Toronto. Mona's ultimate goal is to foster her students' positive attitude toward learning French; she believes that using games in her instruction will get her closer to her goal. A lack of resources is not an issue for her as she adjusts traditional and paper and pencil games based on her learning goals as well as her students age, background experiences, language proficiency, and interests.
