## Key Points

- **Background**: My personal journey to developing fluency in Spanish was through gaming, and so I felt strongly that this popular pastime would help my students, too. Ocarina of Time was a natural choice, as it is not only my favorite game, it is also dialogue-heavy and mimics real life speech, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play it with my students!
- **Aim**: My main objective was to improve students‚Äô Spanish reading comprehension. Other objectives included: developing an understanding of the difference between equivalent and literal translation, developing a more comprehensive understanding of Spanish sentence structure, learning the 100 most used Spanish verbs, and being able to understand perfect verbs and object pronouns when encountered in text.
- **Methods**: Engaging learners through play, student collaboration, ungraded practice, semantic and syntactic reading comprehension, spiraling curriculum, and gamification of rote memorization.
- **Results**: Students‚Äô Spanish reading comprehension improved rapidly, and so did their confidence in performing this skill. Students also learned 90%+ of the 100 top used Spanish verbs, as well as a large variety of other vocabulary.
- **Conclusion**: Video games are a viable resource for teaching a foreign language.
