## 👨‍🏫 Profile

Having learned English with games myself I have become obsessed (the good kind of obsesses) to give my students a similar awesome experience. After clashing with the disappointment in CALL I started repurposing social deduction games to teach English to in a junior high school in Japan. It was so amazing that I just could not stop there and started an education MA, culminating with my thesis: “Co-designing a Game-Based Language Teaching Framework: Analysis of the Teacher’s Perspectives and the Effects on Students’ Motivation and Learning Outcome”.
It was so good I just could not stop there x2. In my Ph.D. studies, I am now exploring the design of games in education more in-depth. Applying instructional design theories and practices and paying particular attention to how AI features are being used in the design of games for learning.
