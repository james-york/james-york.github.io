## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I am a game-based education enthusiast, currently having GBLT classes in a JHS, and I am working on finding ways to connect GBL theories to actual practice. I tend to focus on the roles of teachers in GBL and with my work I am trying to bypass the common issue of teachers lack of game literacy.
