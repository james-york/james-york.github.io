## 👨‍🏫 Profile

My main area of interest is game-based language teaching (GBLT) with a big stress on the T. Like the other fellows here on LLP I am trying to fight the misconceptions that games are easy-to-use teaching shortcuts. I am currently researching teacher agency in game-based classes and trying to create new ways to make pedagogically solid ludic teaching solutions involving games which are accessible to teachers with low game literacy.
