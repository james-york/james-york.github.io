# LLP Compendium

<!--more-->

Since game-based language teaching and research is such a “new” field, there are not many publicly available research or teaching materials. A lot of the literature is hypothetical or exploratory.

With the LLP Compendium, we hope to change that.

When articles or walkthroughs are submitted and accepted for publication, we will ask authors to consider submitting Creative Commons licensed versions of their materials that we will host in in a shared google drive folder connected to their published paper. These materials might be surveys or tests from articles that other researchers can use in their research (to help connect research in the field) or lesson plans and worksheets (to help teachers easily implement progressive practices in their contexts). Authors will determine the rights to their “donated” materials.

You can access all of the materials submitted so far by clicking the button below.
