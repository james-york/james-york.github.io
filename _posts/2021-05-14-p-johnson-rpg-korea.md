## Abstract

- **What is this?** This is an explanation, summary, and reflection on my use of tabletop roleplaying games with my first and second year EFL university students.
- **Why did you make it?** Tired of disinterested students who have grown exhausted from boring textbooks, and despite my best efforts at motivating them, I realized that what was needed for some was not only a change in teaching technique, but a change in place. So I decided to take my students on a journey.
- **Who is it for?** This is for language teachers of students of all ages who are looking to provide their students with an organic, interesting, and fun way of engaging in their L2.
