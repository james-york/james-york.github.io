## Abstract

- **What is this?** A weird collection of thoughts, ideas, questions, and art related to confusion about whether language or art or anything can lead to real world action.
- **Why did you make it?** I’m interested in ideas and media and creativity and participation in society. How are those linked? In a lot of ways, I think.
- **Who is it for?** It’s for anyone who has ever sketched an idea on a piece of paper and then done nothing with it. It’s for anyone who struggles thinking about social issues. It’s for anyone who hopes, somehow, to empower students and help transform them and society. Somehow.
