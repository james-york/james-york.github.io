## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Louvain, Belgium, deeply engaged in exploring the intersection of technology and language education. My research primarily focuses on digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) and its impact on L2 speaking. By integrating digital technology into language teaching, I aim to enhance teaching methodologies and improve learner outcomes, particularly in the area of speaking fluency.
