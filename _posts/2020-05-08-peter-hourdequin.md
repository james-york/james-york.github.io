## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I work at a university in Japan where I teach undergraduate courses in English integrated skills, writing, oral communication, and a CLIL course on cross-cultural communication. I teach a graduate course on pragmatics called “Oral Communication Research.” I also run  a game lab at my university where our current focus is a grant-funded project on “participatory game design as education for sustainable development.” This means that I am trying to lead a group of colleagues and students at our university in multiple collaborative sustainability-focused board game design projects.  We are trying to involve the surrounding community in these projects and share the fruits of our labor for positive social impact.
