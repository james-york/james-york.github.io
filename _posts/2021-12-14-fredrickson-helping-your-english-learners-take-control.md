## Abstract

- **What is this?** Serious suggestions for helping students improve their English in their out-of-class video-gaming time (or their use of other authentic English language content).
- **Why did you make it?** Most literature for teachers naturally focuses on in-class activities, but video gamers spend much more time on their games outside of class.
- **Who is it for?** Teachers who want to encourage their students to actively use authentic English-language materials outside of class.
- **Why do we need this?** The multiplayer video game universe is huge and offers learners a great chance to improve their second-language skills with players from around the world.
