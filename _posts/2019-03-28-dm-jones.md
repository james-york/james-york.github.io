## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I have a combination of EFL and ESL experience and have worked with learners in a wide range of contexts. These days, I am implementing a GBLT approach and curriculum at a language school in Vancouver, Canada. My MA TESOL thesis topic is language teacher cognition related to tabletop game use. This remains my primary area of research focus and I hope to explore it further in the future. I am currently working on a project exploring teacher cognition related to tabletop game design. The first game that I can remember playing is Hungry, Hungry, Hippos. I am still trying to recapture the joy that I felt when my hippo managed to eat his first marble.
