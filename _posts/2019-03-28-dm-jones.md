## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I am an assistant professor in the Communications Faculty at University Canada West (Vancouver, BC). I teach courses related to media literacy and communications. My doctoral research (Queen's University) focuses on the effectiveness of multilieracies pedagogy for teaching language and literacies (media literacy, critical media literacy, new media literacies, modes of meaning, and game literacy). My MA TESOL thesis explored language teacher cognition related to classroom game use, with special attention to both game literacy and pedagogical literacy. In my spare time, I like listening to Steely Dan records, going to concerts, and collecting ancient coins.
