## 👨‍🏫 Profile

My hat collection keeps growing! These days, the hat that I wear the most is ‘Ph.D. student.’ My research focus is on language teacher professional development and learning related to teaching with games. This hat is a bit too big for my head, but I am hoping that I will grow into it. My other hats include ‘language learner’, ‘language teacher’, ‘researcher’, ‘LLP community member’, ‘gamer’, ‘explorer of connections’, ‘coffee addict’, and ‘partner’. See you at the hat parade!
