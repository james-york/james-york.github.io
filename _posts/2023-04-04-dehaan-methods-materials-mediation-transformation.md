## Abstract

- **What is this?** This is a clear example of how to connect a teaching method, simple materials, and careful teacher mediation to help students move from playing a game to participating in society. In addition to the hi-definition example, there are simple worksheets for teachers to use to plan their own links between games, methods, materials, mediation and goals.
- **Why did you make it?** I thought that the example from my class would spark some ludic language pedagogy joy in others. I certainly enjoy these teaching moments. These moments didn‚Äôt happen for me before I started thinking more about how to help students participate in society with/around a game and ‚Äúgood teaching.‚Äù
- **Who is it for?** It‚Äôs for teachers who can‚Äôt imagine the nitty gritty of a ludic language classroom focused on social participation with and around games.
