## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I am currently working on establishing a TRPG project at my university and looking for guidance left and right in fields such as task based language learning, drama paedagogy etc. Further creating bridges between different cultures, emphasize intercultural learning, e-learning and developing casual approaches to teach and experience elements of culture are things I am at least somewhat invested in.
