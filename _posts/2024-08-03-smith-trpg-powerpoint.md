## Key Points

- **Background**: While wondering and experimenting with different ways to incorporate creative thinking and students‚Äô interests into my English as a foreign language (EFL) lessons, I developed a Tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) that uses PowerPoint and Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) rules/materials to immerse students in an adventure while at the same time developing their English proficiency and confidence.
- **Aim**: To craft a straightforward yet enjoyable TRPG accessible to English learners of all levels, fostering the development of their reading, writing, listening, speaking, and critical/creative thinking skills. 
- **Methods**: My TRPG, hereinafter referred to as EL Adventures, takes the core rules and concepts of D&D and simplifies them, allowing teachers (the Dungeon Masters) to primarily focus on their students (the players) actively participating and using English. The PowerPoint presentations not only enhance the comprehensibility and fun factor of the story for students through pictures, animations, sounds, and text but also alleviate the teacher's need to memorize the story text. While dice play a pivotal role in determining certain outcomes, the student's success in the game hinges on direct communication with the teacher, teamwork, and creative problem-solving as they confront challenge after challenge of varying difficulty levels.
- **Results**: EL Adventures provided my EFL students with opportunities to practice reading, writing, and speaking English through intricate storylines, character creation, epic battles, and a variety of challenges.
- **Conclusion**: Not all lessons can be taught from a textbook; sometimes they are taught on a noble quest in a fantasy world.
