## 🔑 Key points

- **What is this?** This is a collection of short talks and lesson plans made by participants of LLPx02. Teachers presented Ludic and Pedagogy elements, then were grouped into teams which had an hour to create a lesson plan, activity, class, workshop or curriculum.
- **What did they make?** Creations included: 
  - An interactive-fiction inspired lesson plan using ChatGPT
  - A TBLT lesson using free, open-source MMOs
  - A PPP lesson plan for young learners using Strategic Interactions
- **Why did you make it?** We want to share more Ludic, Language and Pedagogy elements with each other and other teaching and research communities. If you want to implement or modify these plans, you can! We would be happy to help you do so. Join our Discord to chat with the Iron Teachers.
