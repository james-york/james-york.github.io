## Key Points

- **Background**: Tabletop games have been a frequent addition to task-based classroom activity.
- **Aim**: This study investigates the potential differences in learning opportunities that arise during collaborative dialogues between learners as they play tabletop games that differ in how they utilize player interaction.
- **Methods**: This study uses a qualitative analysis of task transcripts using the construct of the Language Related Episode.
- **Results**: Tasks did not produce any major differences in quality or number of LREs between games, but across games a vast majority of LREs were prompted specifically by cards with text during the game.
- **Conclusion**: Tabletop games may not afford an abundance of specific language talk, but more research is necessary to get a better idea of how learners handle L2 gaps during gameplay.
