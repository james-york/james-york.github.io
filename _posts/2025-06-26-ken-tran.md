## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I'm an EFL teacher with 8+ years of classroom experience, a board game developer, and an independent researcher specializing in game-based learning. I co-founded GRAM-Z, Vietnam’s first board game studio focused on language education, creating games grounded in pedagogy and learner engagement. My research centers on how tabletop games foster communication, cultural understanding, and learner agency. I actively support board game communities in Saigon and Hanoi through playtests, teacher workshops, and English board game nights. I’ve presented at TESOL conferences and am currently preparing a research submission on game-based learning in Vietnam.
