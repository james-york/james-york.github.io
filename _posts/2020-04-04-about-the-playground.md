In many forms

## Why it is called the LLP Playground

The LLP Playground is a place to experiment and play which mimics real-life playgrounds on many levels:

| Playgrounds  	| LLP Playground  	|
|---	|---	|
| Are public  	| **Is public**  	|
| Are free to use.   	|  Is open-access. Anyone can submit or access. 	|
|   Inspire new ways of playing, and there are always other people around to play with.	|  Encourage rapid prototyping and sharing with a growing community of teachers and researchers.  	|
| Provide spaces and tools to encourage play, to exercise ideas, and build up strengths.   	| Provides a space and tools, linked by tags, to help practitioners play, share, and build ideas with others.  	|
| Are often outdoors  	|  A place outside of typical academia. Experiment with playful, atypical, radical, or modern yet impactful academic publication formats 	|
|   Flexible. Allow for structured and unstructured play.	|   Flexible. Submitted items can be: *works in progress (WIPs), conversation starters, think pieces*, but may also be **peer-reviewed and published** (let us give you the badge you deserve!)|

# Open-peer review (OPR) process for playground items

1. Playground items are submitted via the submission Google Form, and the author decides if they would like OPR or not.
2. The editors look at the submission and decide if it fits LLP.
3. If it fits, 
  - [NOT PEER REVIEWED] it is published on the site and announced on Slack, Twitter and possibly our monthly newsletter.
  - [PEER REVIEWED] the call for reviewers is announced on Slack and Twitter, and possibly the monthly newsletter.

There is a 2-week OPR period. Anyone can be a reviewer.

After that, the author gets the chance to edit it. The author decides the time they need.

Once the edits have been made by the author(s), the final piece is published on the site with pages assigned in the current volume.

## Playground peer reviewing

Peer reviewers can 
- Praise, 
- Write their thoughts,
- Ask for clarification,
- Provide additional insights,
- Ask for citations,
- Give advice.

If someone reads the paper but does not comment, this is not considered peer-review.

Reviewers may give additional comments in the #playground slack channel.


## After the review period is over

Authors can
- Address the comments in the paper and then resolve them.
- Resolve comments on the google docs without addressing them.
- Keep certain comments as footnotes, referencing the place where the comment was made (such as those comments that were particularly pertinent or helpful or positive, etc.).

Editors will
- Publish the document on the LLP website within 2 weeks of the author‚Äôs notification that it has been completed.
