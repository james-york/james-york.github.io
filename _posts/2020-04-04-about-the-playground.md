# What is the LLP Playground?

<!--more-->
A playground presents **methods**, **materials**, **concepts** or **experiences** based in **practice** and grounded in theory that can serve to inform, inspire or challenge practitioners and/or researchers. How a playground is based in practice, and how it is grounded in theory, can then be very individual, as long as these two things are given. There must be value in it for the reader, not only for the author.

# Open-peer review (OPR) process for playground items

## Submit stage

1. Playground items are submitted via the submission Google Form.
2. Please fill out the ‚ÄúPlayground pass‚Äù section.
3. The editors evaluate whether the submission fits LLP based on the same ‚ÄúPlayground pass‚Äù rubric.
4. If it fits, the call for reviewers is announced on Discord and Twitter, and possibly the newsletter.

## Review stage
1. There is a 2-week Open Peer Review period. 
2. Anyone can be a reviewer (on the Discord server, who has agreed with the OPR statements).
3. Reviewers must also make a copy and complete the ‚ÄúPlayground pass‚Äù rubric.

- **Peer reviewers can:**
  - Praise,
  - Write their thoughts,
  - Ask for clarification,
  - Provide additional insights,
  - Ask for citations,
  - Give advice.
- If someone reads the paper but does not comment, this is not considered peer-review.
- Reviewers may give additional comments in the #playground Discord channel.

## Post-review stage
1. After the review, the author gets the chance to make revisions.
2. The author decides the time they need.
3. Once the edits have been made by the author(s), the editors will check to see if the playground is suitable for publication, taking into account the reviewers‚Äô evaluations (see the ‚Äúplayground pass‚Äù). 
  - **If it fits, great!** The final piece is published on the site with pages assigned in the current volume. 
  - **If it doesn‚Äôt fit**, the author(s) will be asked to make additional edits before publishing (This may include another round of peer-review).

Authors must:
- Address the comments in the paper and work with the reviewer to resolve them.

Authors can:
- Ask reviewers for clarification on the LLP Discord.
- Keep certain comments as footnotes, referencing the place where the comment was made (such as those comments that were particularly pertinent or helpful or positive, etc.).

Editors will:
- Publish the document on the LLP website within 2 weeks of the author‚Äôs notification that it has been completed.
