## Abstract

- **What is this?** A set of in-depth examples that frame a single game into different pedagogical approaches.
- **Why did you make it?** We felt that the literature on game-based learning lacks examples of HOW to use a game with various methodologies and curricular goals.
- **Who is it for?** For teachers that would like to try using games in their language classroom but are stuck in limbo between theory and practice. 
- **Why do we need this?** We think that practical examples on how to use a game in more than one way might help spread the love for more instances of Ludic Language Pedagogy.
- **What is it not?** This is not a paper that promotes MONOPOLY as the best option to teach languages with games.
