## 👨‍🏫 Profile

My research interests revolve around language teacher emotions, attitudes and practices in English language teaching. As a former English language teacher I have worked with young students, and have employed commercial games in order to facilitate creative writing, social and communication skills. Drawing from classroom experience, I investigate the optimal ways of incorporating games (digital or physical) in foreign language learning.  Currently, I am working with language teachers and designing workshops to promote game-based language teaching and empower teachers to create and apply games in their teaching meaningfully.
