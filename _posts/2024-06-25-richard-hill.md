## üë®‚Äçüè´ Profile

Currently researching how to use A.I. to obtain writing prompts with writing classes. Teaching writing, alongside presentation, TESOL and Communication Theory classes. Contributed to a card game designed to randomize conversations with Anton Vegel. Trialled a self-access centre and published the findings in RELAE journal. Looking to fine-tune my research to be less broad.
