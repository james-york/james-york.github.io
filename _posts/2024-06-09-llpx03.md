## 🔑 Key points

- **What is this?** This is a collection of short talks and lesson plans made by participants of LLPx03. Teachers presented Ludic and Pedagogy elements, then were moved into groups to discuss common topics of interest.
- **Why did you make it?** We want to share more Ludic, Language and Pedagogy elements with each other and other teaching and research communities. If you want to implement or modify these plans, you can! We would be happy to help you do so. Join our Discord to chat with us.
