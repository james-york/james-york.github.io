## Abstract

- **Background:** Board games were utilized with rigorous pre and post-play activities in an EFL classroom context to promote L2 development.
- **Aim:** The aim of this paper is to assess whether the post-play activities improved participantsâ€™ speaking skill.
- **Methods:** Using complexity, accuracy and fluency measures, as well as reference to learnersâ€™ completed workbooks, output performance was analysed quantitatively.
- **Results:** Output accuracy was significantly improved in the second gameplay session, however complexity and fluency dimensions were not affected. A number of common morphosyntactic errors were also left unnoticed.
- **Conclusion:** Whilst student-driven post-tasks aided learnersâ€™ L2 development; particularly along the accuracy dimension, additional teacher instruction is required.
