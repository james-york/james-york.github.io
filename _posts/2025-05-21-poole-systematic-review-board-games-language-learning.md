## KEY POINTS

- **Background**: Board games are a promising tool for integrating games into the classroom setting, yet research on their effectiveness is sparse. 
- **Aim**: This systematic review examines empirical research on board games used for language learning. The participants, instructional approach, research methods, and outcomes for these studies are reviewed to provide suggestions for further research.
- **Methods**: The review synthesizes findings from empirical studies, analyzing how board games are implemented in language teaching contexts. Studies were grouped based on their instructional design, research methodology, and language learning focus to identify common trends and gaps in the literature.
- **Results**: Findings indicate that board games are used to support vocabulary acquisition, grammar reinforcement, communicative competence, and reading comprehension, while also fostering motivation and reducing anxiety. 
- **Conclusion**: Board games offer a promising tool for language learning, but their effectiveness depends on pedagogical implementation, learner engagement, and instructional context. The review concludes with pedagogical implications and recommendations for future research, particularly in understanding how board games can be optimized for long-term language acquisition and integrated with other teaching methods.
