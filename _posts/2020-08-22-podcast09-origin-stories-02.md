5. How widespread is the use of games at your institution? 
6. How do games fit into the institution / curriculum where you teach?
7. SUPER IMPORTANT QUESTION ALERT: What role(s) do YOU play in your game based teaching? 

### The field (community)
8. What teaching communities are you involved with?
9. To what would you compare your journey in the field of games and learning?
10. What do you think new teachers need to start using games?

### Doing now? Doing next?
11. What are your current projects? → Where will you share your work?
12. What would you like to do in the future?
13.  Where can we learn more about you? → social links
