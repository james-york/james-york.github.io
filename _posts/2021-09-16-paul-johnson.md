## üë®‚Äçüè´ Profile

I was born and raised in Southern California. I have an M.A. in Philosophy and am working towards my MSc TESOL with a Specialism in Technology for Teaching at the University of St Andrews. I have been teaching English as a Foreign Language internationally for over eight years and write about education technology, language teaching, ethics, games, and gamification. It's important to me that I continually improve at basketball.
