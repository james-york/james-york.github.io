## KEY POINTS

- **What is this?** This is a reflection on and sharing of our growth journeys
in our graduation seminar.
- **Why did you make it?** In our seminar, 11 students embarked on unique
self-growth journeys, each with our own goals and methods. Although
we played the same games, we engaged in different activities and had
diverse experiences. Yet, we found ourselves growing in similar areas,
such as language, confidence, and study skills. Learning can come from
many forms of media, especially through experiential learning. We want
to share our insights and experiences with you.
- **Who is it for?** This is for teachers interested in integrating the Pedagogy
of Multiliteracies with games, as well as for students looking to explore
active learning approaches
