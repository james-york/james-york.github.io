## 👨‍🏫 Profile

I am a Canadian citizen who has been teaching English as a second/foreign language for nearly two decades. I spent the majority of that time in South Korea where I worked with learners of all ages, and I have recently moved to Japan, where I teach in the English for Global Citizens program in the College of Global Engagement at Kansai Gaidai University.

My research interests include attitude and motivation and the other social, political, and economic factors influencing the study of English around the world. I have recently been focused more on game-based language learning, as I refuse to believe that the massive amount of interesting text available in RPGs and card games cannot be utilized for language acquisition.
