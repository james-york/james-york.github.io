## Content

In this episode, hosts James and Jonathan interview Tobias Staaby as part of a new series of podcasts which we are calling "Origin Stories." The interview format for this series is to ask a game-based teacher the following questions to understand how they started and how other teachers can get involved:

### Background
- What or who inspired you to start teaching with games? 
- How did you start?
- How long have you been teaching with games? In what subjects? How often?

### The classroom context
- What kind of institution do you work at? 
- How widespread is the use of games at your institution? 
- How do games fit into the institution / curriculum where you teach?
- *SUPER IMPORTANT QUESTION ALERT:* What role(s) do YOU play in your game based teaching? 

### The field (community)
- What teaching communities are you involved with?
- To what would you compare your journey in the field of games and learning?
- What do you think new teachers need to start using games?

### Doing now? Doing next?
- What are your current projects? → Where will you share your work?
- What would you like to do in the future?
- Where can we learn more about you? → social links
