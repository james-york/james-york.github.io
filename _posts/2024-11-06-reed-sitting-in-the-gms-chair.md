## Key Points

- **What is this?** This paper expands the definition of “gamemaster” to include board/card games, moving it beyond the confines of the TRPG space, and shares observations from a student gamemaster (GM) through an interview.
- **Why did you make it?** To help educators know what qualities are necessary in a gamemaster, and therefore how to help develop those competencies in students to grow and expand their ludic language teaching courses.
- **Who is it for?** Teachers who want to use games in their classes and empower students to be facilitators instead of trying to GM everything on their own. This is particularly relevant for larger classes/clubs where having one teacher GM is not ideal or feasible.
