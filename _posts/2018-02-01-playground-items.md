A playground presents **methods**, **materials**, **concepts** or **experiences** based in **practice** and grounded in *theory* that can serve to *inform*, *inspire* or *challenge* practitioners and/or researchers. How a playground is based in practice, and how it is grounded in theory, can then be very individual, as long as these two things are given. There must be value in it for the reader, not only for the author.

The LLP Playground is full of amazing teaching and research items which can be shared, discussed, and *peer-reviewed.*
