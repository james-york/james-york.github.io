## 6. Generative AI Policy

Ludic Language Pedagogy recognises that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools are increasingly used in research and academic writing. While such tools may support certain aspects of academic work, their use must be transparent, ethical, and consistent with academic integrity.

Generative AI tools (including large language models, image generators, and automated analysis systems) do **not** meet the criteria for authorship and must not be listed as authors or co-authors. Human authors remain fully responsible for the accuracy, originality, and integrity of all submitted content.

Where GenAI tools are used, the following conditions apply:

* Use of AI-generated text must be explicitly disclosed in the **Acknowledgements** section, including the purpose of use. AI-generated text must not replace the authors’ original scholarly interpretation.
* Use of AI-generated images, diagrams, audio, video, or game-related assets must be clearly stated in relevant captions, including a brief description of the tool and process used.
* Use of AI to generate synthetic data, teaching materials, or reading materials must be explicitly described in the manuscript.
* Use of AI tools for data analysis, coding, text mining, or pattern detection must be documented in the **Methods** or **Methodology** section.

Authors are responsible for ensuring that AI-generated outputs:

* do not include plagiarised material,
* appropriately cite third-party content,
* and are not used to fabricate data, falsify results, or mislead readers.

Disclosures of AI use should include, where applicable, the name and version of the tool, the provider or platform, dates of use, relevant customisation or inputs, and any known limitations or biases.

The editorial team reserves the right to request further clarification regarding AI use and to reject submissions where AI use is deemed unethical, insufficiently disclosed, or incompatible with the journal’s scope.
