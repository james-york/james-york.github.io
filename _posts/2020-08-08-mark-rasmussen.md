## üë®‚Äçüè´ Profile

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Utah studying Clinical Audiology. I intend to work in Aural Rehabilitation, or helping children and adults (re)develop auditory skills that may be hindered due to hearing loss or hearing-related trauma. I taught English for eight years, primarily in South Korea. I completed my MA TESOL at Sookmyung University where I studied sociocultural theory with Levi McNeil. My research has examined the political economy of intercultural relationships, emotion communication between tutors and students and my thesis was an examination of the perception of English vowels by Korean EFL students as a function of their experience living in English-speaking contexts.

I am currently working with the Speech Perception Lab at the University of Utah (P.I. Dr. Sarah Ferguson), where I help run experiments and analyze acoustic data. I also assist in the Auditory Perception Lab at the University of Utah (P.I. Dr. Skyler Jennings).
