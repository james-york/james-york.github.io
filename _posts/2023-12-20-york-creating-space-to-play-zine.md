## Abstract

- **What is this?** A zine which helps teachers think about how they can create SPACE for their students to have gratifying experiences.
- **Why did you make it?** To give teachers something simple to use as they start to think about how they could be ludic teachers.
- **Who is it for?** This is an important question. 
  - It is primarily for practitioners/teachers who are curious as to how they can create an environment that inspires gratifying experiences for their students.
  - Secondly, I hope researchers and academics see the value in this SPACE-based learning metaphor which melds together key tenets of several approaches to ‚Äúgood‚Äù educational practice.
