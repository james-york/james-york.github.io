## Tweet Synopsis 

> There are few practical guides to teaching specific skills with specific games. This is one. You don’t need computers, or tablets, just a board game which you could make yourself. This is how to put games at the core of your language class. *#GBLT #KotobaRollers*


## Key points

- 📍 **What is this?** A short, easy-to-read example of my Kotoba Rollers framework for teaching English with the game Captain Sonar.
- 📍 **Why did you make it?** My Kotoba Rollers walkthrough paper in LLP is a deep dive and covers the whole framework from 10,000m up. With this, I wanted to create a simpler, easily implementable lesson plan around a single game.
- 📍 **Who is it for?** Teachers that are interested in teaching with games and are looking for a concise, practical and usable guide with a specific game.
- 📍 **What’s next?** If the reception to this piece is positive, I would like to continue making guides for teaching with various games.
