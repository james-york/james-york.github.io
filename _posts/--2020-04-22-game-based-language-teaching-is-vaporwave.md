## Tweet Synopsis 

> 👤 There’s no need to rush gameplay in a classroom. 
> 🏁 15 minutes at the end of the week? Too short. 
> 🌺 Take your time. Give students time. Slow it down.
> 🌴 Good GBLT is like ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ; not nightcore.
> 🌊 #gbl #gamebasedlearning




## Key points

- 👤 **What is this?** A playful conceptualization of game-based language teaching as ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ.
- 🏁 **Why did you make it?** During an interview, I came upon the concept of GBLT as ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ. This document is an exploration of the concept in more detail and as a place for others to discuss and comment on.
- 🌺 **Who is it for?** Teachers who are unsure where games fit into their curriculum, how often to use them, how long they should be used for, what to do before or after games, etc.
- 🌴 **What is ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ?** Essentially, slowed down 80s pop music, which gives it a modern, interesting ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ.
