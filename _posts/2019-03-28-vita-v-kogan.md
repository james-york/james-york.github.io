## üë®‚Äçüè´ Profile

‚ÄúI love languages: I love speaking, researching and teaching them. Currently, I am a lecturer in linguistics at the University of Kent, the U.K., where I research second language acquisition. My research concerns the cognitive mechanisms of speech perception and how individuals differ in this regard. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the Defense Language Institute, a language school for military linguists in California, USA, where I taught Russian as a second language.‚Äù

I am also interested in multilingualism and innovative pedagogy such as content- and task-based learning (see my interview on it), open architecture curricular design, and cognitive/neurolinguistic approaches to L2 teaching. In the past 10 years, I have been designing, leading and teaching language programs at several postgraduate and undergraduate educational institutions in the U.S. Just as my research interests are guided by my teaching experiences, I make sure to bring research back into the classroom. I create and teach highly pragmatic curricula with an emphasis on thought-stimulating content, contextualized authentic input, and creative use of technology.

I also designed and commercialized Linguapolis, a board game for teaching conversational English. Currently, it sells all around the world; we also organize game nights and inform teachers on the topic of gamification in education.
