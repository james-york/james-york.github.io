LLP is a non-profit project to bring together people and conversations around how best to integrate games and play into language teaching and learning.

# 🆕 LLP Membership

## Reason 1

We are aiming to get LLP registered as an "official" academic society in Japan. This means we need 100 members! Help us get there by signing up.

## Reason 2

Expenses are mostly for DOIs (Crossref charges us to have them), as well as server upkeep. This is not sustainable, and one of the reasons we want to do a push for the community to support this. We want to start a membership program for LLP and are able to support ourselves financially.
