# What is the playground?

- A place to play, to share, to gather, to explore.
- A place to experiment with playful, atypical, radical, or modern yet impactful academic publication formats
- Encourage rapid prototyping and sharing
- A place to share WIPs to get ideas out in the open
- A place where WIPs can be peer-reviewed and published (let us give you the badge you deserve!)
